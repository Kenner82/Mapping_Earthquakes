# Overview

Using GeoJSON data on recent earthquakes, maps were generated in various styles with overlay layers for tectonic plates, all earthquakes, and major earthquakes. Earthquake markers varied in size and color based on the magnitude of the earthquake, and pop-ups denoted the magnitude and location of the quake.
